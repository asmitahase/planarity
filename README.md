# [Planarity](https://asmitahase.github.io/planarity/)
Planarity is a puzzle based on the concept of [Planar Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_graph)
A planar graph is a graph in which the edges intesect only at the vertices. The goal of the puzzle is to untangle the tangled graph to reveal its planar nature.

The game uses [John Tantalo's](http://johntantalo.com/) [algorihtm](http://johntantalo.com/wiki/Planarity/) to generate planar graphs.
